I am a computational scientist specializing in the intersection of **Machine Learning** and **Molecular Modeling**. I recently completed my PhD in Data Science and Computation at the [University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/) and the [Italian Institute of Technology (IIT)](https://www.iit.it/).

My research focuses on end-to-end drug discovery, ranging from processing large-scale structural data (200k+ structures) to developing **3D-CNN architectures** and running high-performance **Molecular Dynamics (MD)** simulations.

I am a passionate open-source contributor (DeepChem) and a [Google Summer of Code 2024](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) mentor. I am currently seeking roles in molecular modeling, data science, or EdTech where I can leverage deep scientific expertise with modern software engineering.

### Core Competencies

- **AI/ML:** PyTorch, Scikit-learn, 3D-CNNs for structure prediction.
- **Comp Chem:** Amber, OpenMM, Gaussian, CP2K, FEP simulations.
- **Dev:** Python, Bash, SQL, Docker, HPC (SLURM).
