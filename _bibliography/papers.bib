  abstract = {DNA polymerases (Pols) add incoming nucleotides (deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTPs)) to growing DNA strands, a crucial step for DNA synthesis. The insertion of correct (vs incorrect) nucleotides relates to Pols' fidelity, which defines Pols' ability to faithfully replicate DNA strands in a template-dependent manner. We and others have demonstrated that reactant alignment and correct base pairing at the Pols catalytic site are crucial structural features to fidelity. Here, we first used equilibrium molecular simulations to demonstrate that the local dynamics at the protein--DNA interface in the proximity of the catalytic site is different when correct vs incorrect dNTPs are bound to polymerase {$\beta$} (Pol {$\beta$}). Formation and dynamic stability of specific interatomic interactions around the incoming nucleotide influence the overall binding site architecture. This explains why certain Pols' mutants can affect the local catalytic environment and influence the selection of correct vs incorrect nucleotides. In particular, this is here demonstrated by analyzing the interaction network formed by the residue R283, whose mutant R283A has an experimentally measured lower capacity of differentiating correct (G:dCTP) vs incorrect (G:dATP) base pairing in Pol {$\beta$}. We also used alchemical free-energy calculations to quantify the G:dCTP {$\rightarrow$}G:dATP transformation in Pol {$\beta$} wild-type and mutant R283A. These results correlate well with the experimental trend, thus corroborating our mechanistic insights. Sequence and structural comparisons with other Pols from the same family suggest that these findings may also be valid in similar enzymes.},

  abstract = {A pseudo-three-component synthesis of N-aroylmethylimidazoles 3 with three new C--N bonds formed regioselectively under microwave conditions was developed. Products were obtained by reacting two equivalents of aroylmethyl bromide (ArCOCH2Br, 1) with the appropriate amidine salt (RCN2H3.HX, 2) and with K2CO3 as a base in acetonitrile. The bicomponent reaction also occurred, giving the expected 4(5)-aryl-1H-imidazoles 4. Notably, the ratio of products 3 and 4 is governed by steric factors of the amidine 2 (i.e., R = H, CH3, Ph). Therefore, a computational study was carried out to understand the reaction course regarding product ratio (3/4), regioselectivity, and the steric effects of the amidine substituent group.},

  abstract = {Quinones are attractive pharmacological scaffolds for developing new agents for the treatment of different transmissible and non-transmissible human diseases due to their capacity to alter the cell redox homeostasis. The bioactivity and potential mode of action of 19 p-quinone derivatives fused to different aromatic rings (carbo or heterocycles) and harboring distinct substituents were investigated in infective Trypanosoma brucei brucei. All the compounds, except for a furanequinone (EC50=38~{$\mu$}M), proved to be similarly or even more potent (EC50~=~0.5--5.5~{$\mu$}M) than the clinical drug nifurtimox (EC50~=~5.3~{$\mu$}M). Three furanequinones and one thiazolequinone displayed a higher selectivity than nifurtimox. Two of these selective hits resulted potent inhibitors of T. cruzi proliferation (EC50=0.8--1.1~{$\mu$}M) but proved inactive against Leishmania infantum amastigotes. Most of the p-quinones induced a rapid and marked intracellular oxidation in T. b. brucei. DFT calculations on the oxidized quinone (Q), semiquinone (Q{$\bullet$}-) and hydroquinone (QH2) suggest that all quinones have negative {$\Delta$}G for the formation of Q{$\bullet$}-. Qualitative and quantitative structure-activity relationship analyses in two or three dimensions of different electronic and biophysical descriptors of quinones and their corresponding bioactivities (killing potency and oxidative capacity) were performed. Charge distribution over the quinone ring carbons of Q and Q.- and the frontier orbitals energies of SUMO (Q.-) and LUMO (Q) correlate with their oxidative and trypanocidal activity. QSAR analysis also highlighted that both bromine substitution in the p-quinone ring and a bulky phenyl group attached to the furane and thiazole rings (which generates a negative charge due to the {$\pi$} electron system polarized by the nearby heteroatoms) are favorable for activity. By combining experimental and in silico procedures, this study disclosed important information about p-quinones that may help to rationally tune their electronic properties and biological activities.},
